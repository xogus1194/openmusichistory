### This piece has several notable features.

Comments: It would be better to show this interesting features with the score and add what parts it is.

	1. Atonality : Typically, music classified as “classical” or “popular” is tonal, meaning it adheres to 
 	a key center that emphasizes tonic and dominant relationships. However, Schoenberg avoided being confined
  	to a specific key. Pierrot Lunaire exemplifies this approach. While it progresses without traditional
   	harmonic structures, it still conveys a strong sense of musicality. 

	2. Sprechstimme: Similar to recitative but distinct, Sprechstimme is a unique technique that lies
 	between singing and plain speech. It involves delivering the text in a speech-like manner while maintaining
  	the pitch of each note.

## Pierro Lunaire & Schoenberg's importance
>He is an **influential figure** in 20th-century modern music, often associated with the Second Viennese School. His works explore new musical concepts, including “atonality” and the “twelve-tone technique.” Compared to Debussy, he is a pioneer of Expressionism and avant-garde music, an approach that later influenced Berg’s serialism.
