# Structure

The Sonata is in four movements:

1. **Allegro ma non troppo**
2. **Allegro marcato**
3. **Andante**
4. **Vivace**



---


### I. Allegro, ma non troppo
The first movement begins with a dynamic energy, adhering to the classical sonata form but infused with Prokofiev's modern harmonic and rhythmic language. It opens with rapid tempos and vigorous rhythms, creating a sense of tension and instability through contrasting themes. The main theme is clear and forceful, but it is repeatedly transformed, showcasing Prokofiev’s use of rhythmic repetition and harmonic shifts. The movement builds on a constant sense of forward momentum, yet it ends with a sense of resolution, bringing some stability to the initially unsettled atmosphere.

### II. Scherzo: Allegro marcato
The second movement is a scherzo, marked by playful and sharp rhythms. This lively and energetic movement is full of humor and technical complexity, characteristic of Prokofiev's music. The "Allegro marcato" directive suggests not just a fast tempo, but an emphasis on strong rhythmic accents, creating a sense of rhythmic punch and sudden contrasts. The scherzo features repeated rhythmic patterns, abrupt changes, and virtuosic passages that challenge the performer. Its lively, mischievous character contrasts with the more dramatic energy of the other movements, and the movement’s unpredictable nature gives it a sense of whimsical playfulness.

### III. Andante
The third movement brings a striking shift in mood, offering a lyrical and introspective contrast to the earlier movements. Marked "Andante," this slow movement is deeply expressive, with delicate melodies and smooth harmonies that evoke a sense of serenity and reflection. Prokofiev steps away from technical virtuosity here, focusing instead on emotional expression. The movement has a tranquil and meditative quality, with a sense of continuity in the melodic lines, creating a sustained emotional depth. This section offers a respite from the previous dynamic energy, immersing the listener in a more contemplative and emotional sound world.

### IV. Vivace
The final movement is a vigorous and high-energy conclusion to the sonata. Marked "Vivace," this movement is characterized by rapid tempos and intense rhythmic drive. Complex and intertwining musical figures create a sense of relentless forward motion, with Prokofiev’s use of fast, intricate patterns providing a challenge to the performer. The movement brings the sonata to an explosive climax, resolving the tensions built in the previous movements. Its dramatic and virtuosic nature wraps up the work with an exhilarating sense of closure, leaving the listener with an overwhelming impression of energy and finality.
